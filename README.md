### What for?

By importing your Twitter archive into Day One with this script, you can:

- Browse your entire tweet history offline with lightning-fast random access
- Rediscover what you posted â€œon this dayâ€œ in past yearsâ€”like [Timehop](https://www.timehop.com), but with no limitations
- Browse all your tweeted photos and videos in a sleek, organized gallery
- Perform full-text searches that actually work
- - Easily purge any unwanted [kompromat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kompromat) from your old tweets

### What's so good about this script?

- Automatically classifies pure tweets, threads, retweets, quote-tweets, replies, etc., and acts accordingly
- Handles threads _beautifully_ and combines them into single, cohesive Day One entries
- Supports media attachments, hashtags, locations
- Appends like/retweet count under each tweet 

I've meticulously analysed nearly every edge case to ensure your tweets will render flawlessly in Day One.

### Caveats

- Day Oneâ€™s free plan lets you add just one attachment per entry. Subscribe to Premium Â¯\\_(ãƒ„)\_/Â¯ (free trial available, feel free to cancel it right away)
- This script only works on macOS Sonoma and newer. If you don't have a Mac, find a friend who does or spin up the virtual machine.

### Usage

1. **Download your Twitter data**  
   Request your archive [here](https://x.com/settings/download_your_data).

2. **If you havenâ€™t used Day One before:**  
   - Install Day One app from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/tr/app/day-one/id1055511498?mt=12).  
   - Open it and (optionally) sign in.

3. **Install the Day One CLI**  
   Follow the [instructions](https://dayoneapp.com/guides/day-one-for-mac/command-line-interface-cli/).

4. **Create a journal for tweets**  
   Go to [dayone://preferences](dayone://preferences), open **Journals**, and add one named `Tweets` (or see [config options](#config-options)).

5. **(Optional) Create a journal for replies**  
   If you want to include replies, add another journal called `Twitter Replies` (or see [config options](#config-options)).

6. **(Optional) Pause sync**  
   Day One will attempt to sync new posts into the cloud automatically. If you're using unreliable or metered connection, you might want to visit Day One preferences â†’ **Sync**, and click **Pause sync for 24 hours**.

7. **Extract your archive**  
   Place the `twitter~.zip` file in this project folder and unzip it.

8. **Important**  
   Set your device time zone to GMT+0 or UTC before launching the script; it's a known bug with dayone2 CLI tool. I've reached out to Automattic, maybe it will be fixed at some point.

9. **(Optional) enable naming of threads by LLM**
   ```bash
   brew install ollama
   ollama pull llama3.1
   ollama serve
   ```
   - Will produce results such as â€œa thread about Formula 1â€œ or â€œa thread about second-hand shoppingâ€œ.
   - Should run fast if you have an M-series processor and 16 GB+ of RAM.
   - Downloads about 5 gb of data, so be mindful of metered connections.

10. Modify configuration and launch the script!

### Config options

Before launching the script, it's important to set `CURRENT_USERNAME` in `config.py` to your most recent Twitter username, or to None if you're going to delete your account forever.

Feel free to adjust other options as well, such as:

- Journal names
- Tweet processing date range
- Option to ignore retweets

**Now execute `chmod +x ./launch.sh && ./launch.sh` within the project folder and enjoy!**

### Known issues

- Some links (e.g. `youtu.be`, `instagram.com`) are being un-Markdowned by Day One app. I've reached out to Automattic about this, too.
- Retweets of long tweets do not contain media; [see example](https://x.com/JonathanSeriesX/status/1436443683642122248). This is a limitation of Twitter Archive.
- Retweets longer than ~125 characters will be truncated with an ellipsis (`â€¦`); this is also a limitation of the archive itself.
- Media thumbnails in Day One app may appear blank at first; theyâ€™ll load once you switch to another window and then back.  

### Plans

- Better packaging
- Support for threads with more than 30 photos inside 
  - Day One limitation, but it can be avoided by splitting long threads with many attachments into multiple posts
- Support for grouping relevant successive tweets into a single post (relevant for 2016 and before, when there were no threads)
