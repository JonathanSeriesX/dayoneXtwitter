Twitter Archive â†’ Day One diary app export tool

I want to build the **ultimate** tool that perfectly moves everything from Twitter to Day One, including threads / conversations, images, etc.

How to:

* Download your data from Twitter [here](https://x.com/settings/download_your_data?lang=en)
* 
If you never used Day One:
* Install Day One from [the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/tr/app/day-one/id1055511498?mt=12)
* Open Day One app and initialise it (sign in to your account, etc.)

* Install Day One CLI https://dayoneapp.com/guides/day-one-for-mac/command-line-interface-cli/



Notes:
Polls are not supported

IT'S VERY ADVISEABLE TO PAUSE SYNC

Before using, please visit dayone://preferences and create a new journal

If you're using a free version of Day One, only one attachment per post then!

Media uploads in Day One heavily depend on your connection quality; until they're complete, you won't see pictures, but be rest assured, they're there

Work in progress!
