Twitter Archive â†’ Day One diary app export tool

I want to build the **ultimate** tool that perfectly moves everything from Twitter to Day One, including threads / conversations, images, etc.

How to:

* Download your data here https://x.com/settings/download_your_data?lang=en

* Install Day One from App Store https://apps.apple.com/tr/app/day-one/id1055511498?mt=12

* Install Day One CLI https://dayoneapp.com/guides/day-one-for-mac/command-line-interface-cli/

* Open Day One app and initialise it (sign in to your account, etc.)

If you're using a free version of Day One, only one attachment per post then!

Work in progress!
